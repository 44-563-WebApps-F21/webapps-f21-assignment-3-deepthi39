            Hassan-I-Sabbah, leader of the Hashshashin assassins, is a shadowy figure behind world politics,
            steering humanity to fall under his rule in the future. Arion reveals to Superman that his 
            presence on Earth has weakened humanity against future threats and in the future, 
            after Superman falls to the cybernetically enhanced Khyber, humanity will die out because of this weakness.
